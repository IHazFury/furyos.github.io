      <p>Today, I discovered that sleeping in until 2pm is not as fun as it sounds. <br><br>
		It's tiring for the day and makes 5pm feel like noon. Breakfast is thrown off. Either way, it has it's "reasons". Last night, I had the idea to make a "best of 2018" music video based off of my Spotify listening habits. Innocent idea, but of course things never are.<br><br>
		How would one figure out what songs were released in 2018 versus added to my collection within the year? Soptify tracks it, but the only time-based sorting is when it was added to the playlist or length. So, to the internet! Spotify API has this nifty feature of letting you grab data as you need it, with some limits. Notable data available is BPM, artist/album art, and the actual data of a song. To access, I had to register as a Spotify Dev and get client keys and such, a surprisingly little amount of work. My issue is a lack of work environments or whatever. Bash? Install, I guess. Node.js? Sure, whatever it is. Python? Fuck Python. I hate you, you weasly code program. 3.0 it is.<br><br>
		There's a hard limit on data retrieval from the API, so any mass retrieval was out of the question. (My library is 3.5k songs, a mere blink to the pros but more than the average user.) Even if I did request such data, how would I save it and sort it from JSON? Googling led me to a nifty site called http://playlistmachinery.com/. Specifically, the http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com tool. It's a nice little scanner for library/playlist data and gives it to you in a nice presentation. I set it up for my entire library (and wow did it slow my PC, 8GB is not enough) with some direction to certain genres being highlighted.

		I have no idea what I had unloaded onto myself.<br><br>
		Earlier in my life, in ye olde middle school, I had discovered through an imgur gallery some cool web-tools. One of them was the <a href="http://infinitejukebox.playlistmachinery.com/">Infinite Jukebox</a>. It seemed cool at the time. Little did I know that these two tools were connected in more than just idea. Echo Nest, a now-defunct music analysis lab, was the original creator of the Jukebox and somehow related to Paul Lamere, the creator of the Organizer. I thin it was employment. Either way, they built the foundation of Spotify's recommendation service and innovated with tools to dig deep into music analysis. Makes sense, as Spotify bought out Echo Nest in 2014. Their API powered some fun things, like a genre visualizer and a <a href="http://static.echonest.com/labs/#gtiab">Girl Talk-ifier</a> for songs. Fun stuff, but based on their old API.

      <p>Science and art are mutually dumb at points, but I'll like them either way. Movies, art, point clouds and the stupid tangents I make are plenty here in this land of undergrad slacking. I'm on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/furyos_">@FuryOS_<a>, so look for more ramblings there if I abandon this page.</p>
