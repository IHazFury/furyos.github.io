      <h3><b>The (Not Really Lost) Lost Art Of Soundtrack Songs</b></h3>
      <h5>Corporate weirdness leaves us with some OK tracks on <span class="w3-opacity">November 17, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Imagine you're watching a movie.</br></br>
In this case, in a theater.  The film you just finished watching has come to a close, an emotional peak leaving you hopeful for the future or some shit. As the credits roll, an unmistakable musical styling has come in. It's your favorite artist! What? It seems someone sold out and did a movie soundtrack. Now you have to listen to a weird song while you clean up your popcorn instead of the score of your now favorite movie. It isn't that bad, is it?</br></br>
Movie soundtracks have always been a thing, since anytime I can remember. These songs have been all of the above: mediocre, annoying, or actually really good songs. Some play in the film, some in the credits, and some get delegated to the "inspired by the motion picture" album. Most notable to me are the good ones. This corporate crossplay has brought us Kid Cudi's "The Rage" (the best part of Rampage besides the CGI), I See Fire (Or A Boatload Of Cash For Me) by Ed Sheeran, the ENTIRETY of the Oblivion soundtrack by M83, and that Black Panther soundtrack. On the flip side, we get the not-so-memorable ones. That opening song from Justice League, Immortals (everyone's favorite Fall Out Boy song of course), the annoying P!nk song (she's still ok though) from Alice In Wonderland and whatever faliure was the Ghostbusters (2016) soundtrack. (Guys, a Mark Ronson and Passion Pit song should be in a GOOD album. #justiceforMR+PP) Hit or miss, it's a genre of it's own that really tests an artist's appeal. Paired right, these albums can do wonders on the charts and do some promoting in the iTunes store, or they can crash and burn with the band hoping that no one stayed into the film long enough to see their bad song blared on IMAX speakers.</br></br>
What makes a good movie soundtrack song good? Freedom.</br>
With artistic freedom, and the right kind of movie pairing, you get a good jam with your movie sandwich. Asking Alicia Keys and Kendrick to do a song for TASM 2 is not the right pairing of tones with a movie that uses Phillips Phillips's Home for over 10 seconds. While the song we got is actually decent, it just isn't right for the film. It did seem to have no limits, just had to be Hero based, so freedom wins in that category. Forcing (because I doubt it was voluntary) both Fall Out Boy and Walk The Moon to do covers of the Ghostbusters theme song is a travesty to the original song and both of the band's reputations. The movie and those artists had a very different audience. About a 30 year difference in age audience.</br></br>
As much as it's fun to trash on bad executions, I'm not a journalist. After all, if you wanted an informative piece, you'd be watching Anthony Melonhead tell you about instrumentation. All respect to the melon, though. Here's some of the songs I cared enough to listen to after finishing my popcorn.</br></br>
YEAH, I LISTEN TO THAT:</br>
-Eminem's "VENOM": Decent rap to finish the best romcom of the year.</br>
-Imagine Dragons's "Levitate": Feels like the movie: just enough for me to care, but not terrible.</br>
-M83's "Oblivion": There's a reason the Blu-ray has an soundtrack-only mode.</br>
-Sia / Labrinth's "To Be Human": Peak movie soundtrack song.</br>
-The "Bright" Soundtrack: Billboard Top 40 puked on a movie, and we now have this album. It's worth it for a couple songs.</br>
-Lorde's "Everybody Wants To Rule The World": They did the movie trailer "slow piano of old 80's theme song" thing to a Tears For Fears song.</br>
-F+TM's Various Soundtrack Songs: Some songs need no introduction nor justification, they're just great.</br></br>
NOTABLE MENTION: The Twilight Saga has some great compilation albums for their films, along with Dallas Buyer's Club and The Great Gatsby. Might not be for me, but still excellent choices.

      <h3><b>Songs are dumb.</b></h3>
      <h5>Something about graphs and subscriptions on <span class="w3-opacity">November 2, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Today, I discovered that sleeping in until 2pm is not as fun as it sounds. <br><br>
		It's tiring for the day and makes 5pm feel like noon. Breakfast is thrown off. Either way, it has it's "reasons". Last night, I had the idea to make a "best of 2018" music video based off of my Spotify listening habits. Innocent idea, but of course things never are.<br><br>
		How would one figure out what songs were released in 2018 versus added to my collection within the year? Soptify tracks it, but the only time-based sorting is when it was added to the playlist or length. So, to the internet! Spotify API has this nifty feature of letting you grab data as you need it, with some limits. Notable data available is BPM, artist/album art, and the actual data of a song. To access, I had to register as a Spotify Dev and get client keys and such, a surprisingly little amount of work. My issue is a lack of work environments or whatever. Bash? Install, I guess. Node.js? Sure, whatever it is. Python? Fuck Python. I hate you, you weasly code program. 3.0 it is.<br><br>
		There's a hard limit on data retrieval from the API, so any mass retrieval was out of the question. (My library is 3.5k songs, a mere blink to the pros but more than the average user.) Even if I did request such data, how would I save it and sort it from JSON? Googling led me to a nifty site called http://playlistmachinery.com/. Specifically, the http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com tool. It's a nice little scanner for library/playlist data and gives it to you in a nice presentation. I set it up for my entire library (and wow did it slow my PC, 8GB is not enough) with some direction to certain genres being highlighted.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		I have no idea what I had unloaded onto myself.<br><br>
		Earlier in my life, in ye olde middle school, I had discovered through an imgur gallery some cool web-tools. One of them was the <a href="http://infinitejukebox.playlistmachinery.com/">Infinite Jukebox</a>. It seemed cool at the time. Little did I know that these two tools were connected in more than just idea. Echo Nest, a now-defunct music analysis lab, was the original creator of the Jukebox and somehow related to Paul Lamere, the creator of the Organizer. I thin it was employment. Either way, they built the foundation of Spotify's recommendation service and innovated with tools to dig deep into music analysis. Makes sense, as Spotify bought out Echo Nest in 2014. Their API powered some fun things, like a genre visualizer and a <a href="http://static.echonest.com/labs/#gtiab">Girl Talk-ifier</a> for songs. Fun stuff, but based on their old API so it no longer works.<br><br>
		Back to the issue at hand. I decided to expand my project to track trends of my library, but this image is all that I can realistically export. The site uses plot.ly and exports it to the site, but that's useless when their exports only work for free under 500kb. This is much larger than that. I tried to work around it, maybe use the html source, but alas, nothing. Then I notice. The program they use requires a subscription for ONLINE use, and they offer the offline download for something called a jupyter notebook. I spent all last night figuring these things out. I sit here today exploring <a href="http://www.twitter.com/plamere">Paul Lamere</a>'s other tools, as they all are pretty rocking.<br><br>
		After the tangent of revamping the site, I should get back to analysis. The super-duper cool end goal is to have a unity room set up with these data points mapped in 3d, allowing you to look around to see their info and relevance to position. In VR. Why do I do this to myself?<br><br><br>
		When I get this figured out, i'll do a writeup on those trends you see. Data! Music! Chamber Pop!
