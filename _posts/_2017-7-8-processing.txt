My process for making a video is as follows:


--Come up with idea
--Ignore it for a week
--Listen to a song that mirrors said idea
--Scrap that idea
--Come up with new idea
--Get too busy to try it
--Finally start pre-production (Building and "writing")
--Get 1/3 way through, hate either the idea or the song
--Replace hated element
--Keep working, hit 95%, pause
--It needs more "something"
--Add something, reducing ETA to 1 month
--Procrastinate
--Finally sit down to finish it
--Render, make thumbnail, and make a description
--Release next day


--Weeks later, look back on it
--"It could've been a lot better"
--Think about what the video leads into story-wise
--"I have an idea"


Fun, isn't it? Well, there's today's post. Quick, rambly, and coherent enough, just the way I like it.
