title: Here's to writing.

Hi, i'm terrible at introductions.

Life has been a very big rollercoaster lately, so I thought writing things might give me a quicker output. This blog will probably be very diverse in content, but 100% written by me. All Fury, all the time. The likelihood of just direct streams from my brain or ramblings is higher here than on my Twitter, as I hate spamming my non-existent followers. This page will be a first-impressions page due to it being the new website homepage, despite the rest of the site remaining. Click home in the top right to go there.

For a first post, this is short, but there is more to come. Hopefully. Eventually.


For now, I'm going to go sort my calendar.
