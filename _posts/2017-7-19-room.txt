First actual post here, getting the hang of formatting.

The best way for me to get into a new mindset is to reorganize my room. I've done it a lot lately, but some things stay in the same place. Today I did a reorganization and I moved my N64 to my shelf as a little but of "you started here." It's nice seeing something I used for so long get that rightful display of power it so deserves. It's common for me to hide something like that in an effort to keep open space, but open space only boosts morale so much.
